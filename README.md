# Game of Life Pygame

This is a visualization based on the evolutionary algorithm as described by the Game of Life or just Life, initially developed by John Conway in 1970.

The major difference between John Conway's game and this one is that this game has a grid with defined dimensions that impacts the evolution of clusters on border cells. This version of the game was inspired by Leetcode question 289. [289. Game of Life,](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/) and that is how I came up with the idea to make the Pygame visualization.
