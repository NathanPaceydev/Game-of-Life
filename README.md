# Game of Life Pygame

This is a visualization based on the evolutionary algorithm as decribe by the Game of Life or just Life, initally developed by Jonh Conway in 1970.

The major difference between John Conway's game and this one is that this game has a grid with defined dimensions that impacts the evolution of clusters on border cells.
This version of the game was inspired from the Leetcode question [289. Game of Life,](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/) and is how I came up with the idea to make the Pygame visualization.
